<p>hai<br />this is going to be a messy page that doesnt make much sense. i can barely make sense of it. <br />also, please dont be mean - this was really hard to write. </p><br /><hr /><h2>Chapter 1 - Over the years</h2><p>okay so im like a fairly different person at school than when im at home. i have been for a while, ive noticed it before and ive never thought much of it. at school, im, to be frank, a teeny weeny bit of a cunt. just a bit though. <br />at home, im nice and caring and i love hugging and cuddling :3<br />at school, im mean, essentially. i dont really want to go into more detail about either of those because im not exactly sure what to write. <br />again, its something ive definitely conscientiously noticed, but i just shrugged it off. </p><p><br />aand over the years, ive very lightly questioned my sexuality. i mean, who hasn’t?<br />when i say lightly, i mean that the following things happened in my head</p><blockquote>hmmm. ive never had a crush on someone. other people have had crushes on people</blockquote><p>“eh, ive got other things to do”<br />wow, thats even worse than i thought. </p><ul><li><p>list item one</p></li><li><p>list item two</p></li><li><p>blahaj</p></li></ul><ol><li><p>no</p></li><li><p>yes</p></li><li><p>blahaj</p></li></ol><p><br />so (x+5)(x+1) = 0, meaning either bracket must be equal to zero. </p><hr /><h2>Chapter 2 - The Thinkening</h2><hr /><h2>Chapter 3 - Realisation</h2><br />
